*****Program Manual*****

***Prerequisites***
To use this program, ensure you have the following installed:

1-Bash
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command-line user interface for Unix-based operating systems. It allows users to interact with the system by typing commands into a terminal window. Bash is a powerful tool that offers a range of features for system administration, scripting, and automation.

2-g++ compiler

The g++ compiler is the GNU Compiler Collection's C++ compiler, part of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). It is a free and open-source compiler used to compile C++ programs. The g++ compiler translates C++ source code into executable machine code, enabling the written programs to run on a computer.


***Compilation***
First, compile the code using the following command:

g++ -o Flux_Jprep.out main.cpp read_geom.cpp vec.cpp


***Preparation***
You will need the files J_extract.sh and Flux_Jprep.out. Follow these steps:

1-Copy J_extract.sh and Flux_Jprep.out to the directory containing your AIMALL program calculations.
Ensure there is a subdirectory named atomicfiles

2-Extracting J Values
Copy the J_extract.sh file into the atomicfiles directory:
cp J_extract.sh atomicfiles/

3-Navigate to the atomicfiles directory and run the following commands:
cd atomicfiles
chmod +x J_extract.sh
./J_extract.sh

This script reads all .int files in the directory and extracts the J values.



***Running the Main Program***

1- Move the produced Total_J.txt file to the directory containing Flux_Jprep.out.

2- Create an input file named ref_atoms.txt. This file should specify the reference atom(s) for which the magnetic field should be perpendicular. For example:

C11 C11
C47 C48

The above file indicates that the electric current should be considered when the magnetic field is perpendicular to atom C11 or perpendicular to the bond between C47 and C48.

3- Make a copy of the .sumviz file in the same directory as Flux_Jprep.out:

cp *.sumviz temp.sumviz

4- Finally, run the program:

./Flux_Jprep.out

This will process the input files and perform the necessary calculations based on the specified reference atoms.
