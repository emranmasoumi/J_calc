for using this program you need bash and g++ compiler.

First compile the code by using the following line:

g++ -o Flux_Jprep.out main.cpp read_geom.cpp vec.cpp

For doing the job you need J_extract.sh and Flux_Jprep.out files.
copy these files to the directory which you have the calculations from AIMALL program.
You should have the directory of "atomicfiles"

copy J_extract.sh file into the atomicfiles directory.
run the follwing lines:

chmod +x J_extract.sh
./J_extract.sh

It reads all .int files and extract the J's from the files.

then copy the produced file "Total_J.txt" to the directory which Flux_Jprep.out file is present.
To run the program you need to have an input file. the name of input file is "ref_atoms.txt"
in this file you give the reference atom or atoms that you want the magnetic field be prependicular to them.
for example the "ref_atoms.txt" file in repository tells the program that we want the electric current when the magnetic fiels is prependicular to atom C11 or prependicular to bond bentween C47 and C4
 we also need to make a copy of ".sumviz file"

if we run the following lines 

cp *.sumviz temp.sumviz
./Flux_Jprep.out
